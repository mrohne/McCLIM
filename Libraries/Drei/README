Drei - an acronym for /Drei Replaces EINE's Inheritor/ - is one of the
editor substrates provided by McCLIM. Drei is activated by default,
but if it gives you problems, you can disable it by evaluating '(setf
clim-internals::*use-goatee* t)'.

System provides lisp syntax analysis facilities. One of them depends
on the 'SWANK', which is a system's dependency. If you want to build
the system without 'SWANK', push ':CLIM-WITHOUT-SWANK' to the
'*FEATURES*' before loading the system.
