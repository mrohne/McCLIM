  :long-description "CLIM debugger application

This is a Common Lisp debugger implemented in McCLIM. It uses the
portable debugger interface developed for the Slime project, and the
graphical layout is also heavily inspired by Slime. Because of Slime I
hope that this works on other implementations than SBCL."
