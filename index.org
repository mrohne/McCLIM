    SDL threading and events
    - certain parts of SDL can only be called from the thread that called SDL_Init
    - on OS X SDL_init must be called from the system main thread
    - do we need to replace the SDL-provided main loop?
    CLIM threading and events
    - single-threaded CLIM presumably calls #'PROCESS-NEXT-EVENT
    - multi-threaded CLIM expects a CLIM-thread that loops on #'PROCESS-NEXT-EVENT
